## **All Stocks Analysis Refactored**
##### The purpose of this analysis is to further help Steve’s parents’ investment plan by analyzing all the stocks in the market.  Though the analysis we provided earlier covers most of the stocks in the market, it may not cover all the clusters of stocks out there. 
##### In 2017, all the stocks except “TERP” have a significantly higher returns through the year. But looking at 2018 data, most of the stocks except a couple, “ENPH” and “RUN”, have a negative return. However, this may serve Steve as a starting point, it is not a good move to determine investment decision making by only undertaking a technical analysis where we focused on price and volume of stocks.  Steve may like to do a more in-depth fundamental analysis of the stocks  where he focuses on other variables such as measure of a company’s profitability, liquidity, solvency, efficiency, growth trajectory, and leverage.

##### In terms of a runtime performance my first analysis took about 0.5 seconds to execute the analysis. And the refactored code was executed more than 2.5 seconds. Hence my second analysis performance is lower than the first one. 

##### Code Refactoring is a way of restructuring and optimizing existing code without changing its behavior. It is a way to improve the code quality. 

### **The advantages of code refactoring**

- Code Refactoring is an important exercise to remove code smell. 
- It helps to find bugs.
- Makes programs run faster. 
- It's easier to understand the code and improves the design of outputs.

### **The Disadvantages of code refactoring**

- The run time is longer
- Time consuming 
- Complexity of code 

##### The advantage of the original code is that it runs faster than the refactored code. The disadvantage is that it didn’t show the color-coded returns of the tickers which is very useful to determine whether a specific stock has a positive or negative return through the years.
